# Echo-Client
This project is an Echo Client-Chat Application designed to facilitate real-time communication between a client and a server. It provides a simple and effective way to demonstrate socket programming concepts and bidirectional data transmission.

                                                                Features
                                                                
Real-Time Communication: Enables live chat between a client and a server.
Echo Functionality: The server echoes the client's messages back, ensuring data transmission is successful.
Multi-User Support: Can be extended to handle multiple clients using threading or asynchronous programming.
Cross-Platform: Works on any system that supports socket programming (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python, Java, or any language supporting sockets
Networking: Uses TCP/IP for reliable communication between the client and the server
                                                              
                                                              How It Works

Server:
  Listens on a specified IP and port for incoming connections.
  Accepts messages from clients and echoes them back.
Client:
  Connects to the server using its IP and port.
  Sends messages to the server and displays the echoed responses.
  
                                                            Code Structure
Server:
  Initializes a socket and binds to a port.
  Listens for client connections and handles incoming messages.
Client:
  Connects to the server and sends messages.
  Receives and displays echoed messages from the server.
